# Captain Framework

This is a lightweight C++ game development framework with a simple game called Captain included for testing.

# Inspirations

The Rocketship game I made earlier with other students: <a href="https://github.com/ChandlerNorth24/cse210-06">https://github.com/ChandlerNorth24/cse210-06</a>

The framework within this Batter Game that we used from our university: <a href="https://github.com/emoryhubbard/batter-incomplete">https://github.com/emoryhubbard/batter-incomplete</a>

Mario Zechner's book called Beginning Android Games has a framework with frame-independent motion, which idea I included into Captain.
